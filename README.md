- I scraped data from the GitHub API to gather user information and their repositories for users based in Mumbai with over 50 followers.
  
- The most surprising fact I found was that many users have a significantly higher number of repositories than followers, indicating active contributions but limited visibility.
  
- I recommend developers focus on building their GitHub presence by engaging with the community, as it may lead to increased followers and collaboration opportunities.
