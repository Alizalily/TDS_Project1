- I scraped data from the GitHub API using Python to collect information about users in Mumbai who have more than 50 followers, along with their public repositories and related statistics.
  
- The most interesting finding from the analysis was that many users have a high number of public repositories compared to their followers, indicating that active contributions do not always correlate with visibility within the community.

- Based on my analysis, I recommend developers focus on enhancing their GitHub profiles by actively engaging with the community, contributing to open-source projects, and networking to improve their follower count and collaboration opportunities.
